# Simple-Math-Lab
Simple calculator I made recently, if you can break it please let me know with the exception message!

The calculator is self contained, download the zip and run the .exe.
Or you can download the source code in the .cs file.

This was originally an assignment for class, however I want to see how far I can take this application as a learning experience.

Please let me know of any suggestions or issues you have with it!
